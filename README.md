### GO Journey


I'm written down some of my method that I learn to Go fast.

- Using syntax and convention similar to Java.
- Apply some pattern in Java into Go
- Practice leetcode to get to know with Go
- Practice some bigger application to get the sense of package and struct design
- Practice some good code with concept from SOLID, OOP
- Reading some big projects to understand how they wire thing together in Golang.
- Reaching to framework to see how they solve common problem: i.e: Gin Gonic for web server, Gorilla for WebSocket.
- I would like to keep GoLang simple and concise, so only apply it into command line, microservices. Other types of application can be better using another language to flatten learning curve.
